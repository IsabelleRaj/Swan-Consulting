## Project Description
In this project, our aim was to create a data-driven understanding of customer churn to improve retention strategies for Swan Teleco.

Using the Single Customer View data from the previous quarter, we analysed customer demographics, identifying key characteristics of churners and the factors influencing their decisions. We also aimed to provide the new customer team with insights into the most desirable customer profiles to maximise retention and identified a suitable incentive to encourage sign-ups for specific products. Finally, we developed a system to assess the churn risk of all remaining customers, enabling the customer service team to proactively address potential attrition.

The primary objectives of this project were:
- **Model development**: To build a logistic regression model to predict customer churn risk (probability).
- **Information presentation deck**: To provide a comprehensive profile of churners, including their demographics (e.g., age, gender, family makeup), product ownership, key factors driving churn, and actionable recommendations for improving retention (e.g., a sign-up factor to incentivise).
- **List of the top 500 customers most likely to churn**.
- **List of the churn risk for the remaining customers**.
